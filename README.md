# ECE-542 Projcet-C4-code

This notebook contains the code for our Competition Project. 

We have used the following files for training our model:
'subject_001_01__x.csv': 'subject_001_01__y.csv',
'subject_001_02__x.csv': 'subject_001_02__y.csv',
'subject_001_03__x.csv': 'subject_001_03__y.csv',
'subject_001_04__x.csv': 'subject_001_04__y.csv',
'subject_001_05__x.csv': 'subject_001_05__y.csv',
'subject_001_06__x.csv': 'subject_001_06__y.csv',
'subject_001_07__x.csv': 'subject_001_07__y.csv',
'subject_001_08__x.csv': 'subject_001_08__y.csv',
'subject_002_01__x.csv': 'subject_002_01__y.csv',
'subject_002_02__x.csv': 'subject_002_02__y.csv',
'subject_002_03__x.csv': 'subject_002_03__y.csv',
'subject_002_04__x.csv': 'subject_002_04__y.csv',
'subject_002_05__x.csv': 'subject_002_05__y.csv',
'subject_003_01__x.csv': 'subject_003_01__y.csv',
'subject_003_02__x.csv': 'subject_003_02__y.csv',
'subject_003_03__x.csv': 'subject_003_03__y.csv',
'subject_004_01__x.csv': 'subject_004_01__y.csv',
'subject_004_02__x.csv': 'subject_004_02__y.csv',
'subject_005_01__x.csv': 'subject_005_01__y.csv',
'subject_005_02__x.csv': 'subject_005_02__y.csv',
'subject_005_03__x.csv': 'subject_005_03__y.csv',
'subject_006_03__x.csv': 'subject_006_03__y.csv',
'subject_008_01__x.csv': 'subject_008_01__y.csv',
'subject_007_03__x.csv': 'subject_007_03__y.csv',
'subject_007_04__x.csv': 'subject_007_04__y.csv'

The following files were used for validation: 'subject_006_01__x.csv': 'subject_006_01__y.csv','subject_006_02__x.csv': 'subject_006_02__y.csv'

Finally these files were used for testing:
'subject_007_01__x.csv': 'subject_007_01__y.csv', 'subject_007_02__x.csv': 'subject_007_02__y.csv' --> (checking predictions)
'subject_009_01__x.csv': 'subject_009_01__y_time.csv','subject_010_01__x.csv': 'subject_010_01__y_time.csv', 'subject_011_01__x.csv': 'subject_011_01__y_time.csv','subject_012_01__x.csv': 'subject_012_01__y_time.csv'

Our prediction files were: 
'subject_009_01__x.csv': 'subject_009_01__y_prediction.csv', 'subject_010_01__x.csv': 'subject_010_01__y_prediction.csv',
'subject_011_01__x.csv': 'subject_011_01__y_prediction.csv', 'subject_012_01__x.csv': 'subject_012_01__y_prediction.csv'

We renamed the prediction files for easy recognition, and were renamed later again to pass the format check script before submission.

All the functions have been annotated for understanding and the references have been also added in the code file. Please feel free to contact us for further information.
